          "description": "Hotel La Vista is located in front of the beach, in the outskirts of Canoa village. It is walking distance away from the \"action\", while being far enough away to avoid the noise from bars and people at night. The hotel is built in modern materials, with comfort in mind. Yet, the use of wooden beams, bamboo and thatch roofs, gives the structure a traditional touch, that adds to integrate it with local \"old fashion\" building style.",
